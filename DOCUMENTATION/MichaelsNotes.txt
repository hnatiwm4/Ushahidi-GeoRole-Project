Feb.20:
	Since all of our team members are preoccupied with other class material and course work, 
	as well as the first sprint being dominated by midterms, our plans during reading week have fallen apart.

	We are disorganized but are making progress in understanding Ushahidi's codebase.  No implementation has
	been decided on as we all work independently trying things out.  Our highest priority goal still is to 
	make the association explicitly defined the a User hiearchy (ie Superadmin-Admin-Member) which is already
	implemented (may not be want we want though).
		    
	Reading week has turned into experimentation and understanding PHP and Ushahidi's codebase, meaning all the
	implementation stories for this week must be pushed to the next sprint.

	Although very undesirable, it is expected as out focus factor is very very low due to heavy course and project
	work in 3 - 4 other classes for all team members (not to mean external responsibities).
	     
	This will be a reoccuring trend of pushing back main stories, but it is still likely we will have a stable
	impelementation or at least prototype by the end of the term.
Feb.23:
	Did a bunch of Kohana tutorials to get a better understanding of the framework.  Most helpful was:
	http://dev.kohanaframework.org/projects/kohana2/wiki/Kohana101

	Note: view for Submit a New Report page is "/Team2/themes/default/views/reports/submit.php"
Feb.24:
	Built a simple PHP controller and view for a possible georole creation page, submit button links to the submit
	page on the Ushahidi instance 
	
	***NOTE: cant seem to get stylesheet to work correctly inside any view created.
	Seems kohana framework re-routes the link from /~jharvard/kohana/index.php/..." to just "/kohana/index.php/..."
Feb.25:
	Had a quick team meeting in during the CMPT 395 Lab, discussed where we are in terms of understanding the code base
	and it seems we are still heavily confused.  We are behind alot in terms of what we set out to plan.  All team members
	have done some kohana and php tutorials to gain a better understanding.  Agreed upon focusing on the first and most
	important user story which is implementing the 'User Hiearchy'.  

	Other members have other projects they ahd to work on so no further work was completed in the lab.

	***gained better understanind go CSS stylesheet and how php works with HTML***
	***created mockup CreateGeorole webpage in admin dashboard***
Mar.3:
	NOTE: to modify the general layout of an interface, need to modify the particular interfaces
	"layout.php" file (ex. views/admin/layout.php)
	
	Added code to admin/layout.php on line 235 to test georole.css
Mar.4
	GEOMETRY layout from submit report page found in "themes/default/views/reports/submit.php"
	GEOMETRY values from submit report page found in the $form[] array object on line 256
	of "application/controllers/reports.php"
	
	$geometries object found in ./default/views/reports/submit_edit_js.php

	*****drawCircle() function located at line 110 in views/map_common_js
